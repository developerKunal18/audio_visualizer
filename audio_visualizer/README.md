# 🎵 Audio Spectrum Visualizer (Terminal Edition) – Python Project 

## 💡 Overview
The **Audio Spectrum Visualizer** is a real-time terminal-based sound visualizer built with Python.  
It captures live microphone audio and displays a dynamic, animated bar spectrum directly in your terminal — just like a music equalizer.

This project combines **signal processing, real-time streaming, and ASCII animation**, making it a unique and visually impressive Python tool.
